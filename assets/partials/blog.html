                At present, I am supporting the fourth more important company in telecommunications in Costa
                Rica. Working in parallel with my clients, I understand them, their business needs and create the 
                proposals to achieve their goals and implement them. The way I make plans real, by doing 
                whatever it takes to help customers to achieve their goals, is paramount and gives me a lot of 
                passion for what I do as a business woman.

She faced challenges in getting a flat as a single woman, and from male managers who did not treat her as an equal. Still, she moved on to get projects from Sri Lanka, Dubai and Australia.
